Civis Job Status Slack Alert
===============

The Movement Cooperative uses Civis Platform to run the data syncs its members rely on.
Civis users are able to monitor the status of these pipelines within the Civis interface, but not all stakeholders are Civis users and if a problem occurs folks have to navigate to another system, such as Slack or TMC's support ticket system, to flag the issue, collaborate on troubleshooting, and get updates on the resolution.
To make this process more efficient, promote transparency, and facilitate collaboration, the TMC Engineering team wrote a script using Parsons to post Civis job and workflow statuses to an internal Slack channel.
Then, the TMC Data & Technology team templatized it so they could create customized versions for member organizations with only the syncs their organization depends on.
